COORDINATES absolute 1.0e-14

# Time steps are really continuation steps and they can vary from
# platform to platform. Right now if the final step number is more or
# less than 10 away from the "gold" result then an error will be
# flagged. So the if the gold has 63 continuation steps and the run to
# be compared takes 74 steps this will fail, whereas if the compared
# takes 72 steps it will pass, assuming it passes other tests. Note that
# only the last step is compared during exodiff for this test.
