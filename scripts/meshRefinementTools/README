make sure cython and python 2.7.x are in use.

In the refineModule directory,

source buildProcess2.7

This will build the refinement module that can be imported into a
pyhton script.  Note that the pythonized cubit is built with Python
2.7 and so must this code be cythonized.  The scripts will build the
module and store it in a subdirectory called build.  Move the
meshRefine.so to a location where it can be found by python or set the
PYTHONPATH accordingly.
