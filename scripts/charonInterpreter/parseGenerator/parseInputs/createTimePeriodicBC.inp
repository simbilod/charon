interpreter shortHelp {Specify a temporally periodic potential applied on a contact.}

interpreter longHelp {Specify a temporally periodic potential applied on a contact, which can be specified as a superposition of two sinusoids and a DC voltage. <> sidesetID is the contact name/type <> geometryBlock is the geometry name the contact is attached to <> amplitude1 and amplitude2 are the amplitudes of the applied sinusoids, in Volts. <> frequency1 and frequency2 are the frequencies of the applied sinusoids, in Hz. <> phaseShift is the phase shift of the second applied sinusoid relative to the first sinusoid, as a percentage of 2\pi. <> DCoffset is the DC voltage applied.}
