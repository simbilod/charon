interpreter name EmitterBaseBoundingBox

interpreter inputLine (emitter base junction bounding box) is {locMin} to {locMax} [ (in x) [ (in y) [ (in z)]]]

interpreter shortHelp {Set the coordinate range of the bounding box in x, y or z}

interpreter longHelp {Set the coordinate range of the bounding box in x, y or z <> units are microns <> This is the bounding box in which the recombination from annealing occurs.}
